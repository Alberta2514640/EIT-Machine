# RP2040 Embedded Code

This version of the RP2040 code runs on top of CircuitPython 9.0.0. It should work on earlier versions of CircuitPython as well, but they have not been tested.

CircuitPython can be downloaded [here](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/) and the CircuitPython library bundle can be downloaded [here](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

This project requires the `adafruit_pioasm.mpy`, `adafruit_74hc595.mpy` library files and the `adafruit_bus_directory` directory from the library bundle. Make sure you download the matching bundle for the version of CircuitPython you are using! Copy the listed items from the unzipped bundle into the `lib` directory on the RP2040's file system.
